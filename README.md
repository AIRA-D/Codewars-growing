Codewars practice :D

This repository was primarily created for myself. 

I recently started to get into tasks solving on https://www.codewars.com to develop in programming directly through pratics. 

Also, thanks to this repository I will be able to go back to past problems and redo them, using the new knowledge.

I am going step by step, from simple to complex.

If you stumbled upon this repository, I would love to hear your advice or criticism.








Thank you for reading this file. <3
